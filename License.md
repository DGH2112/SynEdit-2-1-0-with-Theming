 SynEdit 2.1.0 with VCL Theming
================================

Author:  David Hoyle

Version: 2.1.0e

Date:    11 Nov 2018

The code contain in the project is all SynEdit 2.1.0 and the licensing in place still adheres. All I've
don't is add VCL theming to the SynEdit control (other may follow in time).

You can use the code as is, I do not retain any rights over this code and the ortiginal SynEdit licenses
are to be retained.
