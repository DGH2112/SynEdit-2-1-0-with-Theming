 SynEdit 2.1.0 with VCL Theming
================================

Author:  David Hoyle

Version: 2.1.0h

Date:    16 Mar 2019

The code contain in the project is all SynEdit 2.1.0 and the licensing in place still adheres. All I've
don't is add VCL theming to the SynEdit control (others may follow in time). Also added support for RAD
Studio 10.3 Rio.

You can use the code as is, I do not retain any rights over this code and the ortiginal SynEdit licenses
are to be retained.
