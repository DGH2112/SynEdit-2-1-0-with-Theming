SynEdit 2.1.0 with VCL Theming Support
======================================

## Theming Support by David Hoyle (SynEdit 2.1.0e with VCL Theming - 11 Nov 2018)

The text below if from the **SynEdit 2.1.0** readme.md file however just a few word on why this
repository exists. I, David Hoyle, do not claim that any of this code is mine, I just use the SynEdit
controls for editing text in my applications. In recent times I've been implementing VCL theming in my
applications and found that **SynEdit 2.1.0** does not support VCL Theming. So I decided to see if I
could update the code and get the SynEdit editor to theme and I've managed to achieve that. Its not been
thoroughly tested and I've only themed the SynEdit control and not anything else at this time. This
unfortunately this isn't a fork directly from SynEdit on GitHub as I've found the live code is sometimes
broken so I took a release copy and baselined it with _Git Flow_ just so that I could monitor then
changes from SynEdit 2.1.0. Its loaded here on my GitHub profile as its used as a _SubModule_ to a number
of my other project which also use _Git_ and this provide a central location to manage the code changes.
Please feel free to use HOWEVER call credit for the code should go to the SynEdit team at
[https://github.com/SynEdit/SynEdit](https://github.com/SynEdit/SynEdit).

## Original readme.md text

This is a fork of the Unicode version of SynEdit hosted ad SourceForge. When it became more and more
difficult to maintain, Eric Grange decided to fork this project on GitHub. This way it's possible to
fork, merge and maintain easier than before.

The original project (with the original readme.txt file) is located here:

http://synedit.sourceforge.net

To get started check out the different examples. If you have questions, please subscribe to the SynEdit
user list and ask there, if you want to hack SynEdit you should subscribe to the SynEdit developer list.
General feedback and suggestions or fixes are welcome.

There is no documentation yet, help in this area is especially welcome!

Historical Note
---------------
SynEdit had been started as an attempt to continue the no longer maintained sources of the mwEdit
project. The last public version 0.92a of mwEdit can be found at the SynEdit website in the download
section.

The mwEdit project was started in 1998 by Martin Waldenburg, aim was to produce a syntax highlighting
editor component for an Open Source IDE. In the 15 months that mwEdit was developed in public Martin was
increasingly dissatisfied with the direction the development of mwEdit took, so he finally requested that
his name and initials had to be removed from the project.
Therefore this is now called SynEdit, and it is an Open Source project under the MPL (Mozilla Public
License, but see the individual source files for the terms).
There would however be no such project if Martin had not started to develop mwEdit, so we would like to
thank Martin Waldenburg for his efforts, and of course all the other developers of the mwEdit project.
